    <h1>HW6 Pt 2 - Andrew Spratley</h1>

    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>Due to accidentally using North Carolina in the last part, I had to switch and used Educational Attainment for those over 25 in the state of Texas.</p>

    <h3>Data</h3>
    <a href="">CSV Dataset</a>
    <a href="">Link to Shapefile</a>

    <h3>Ratio Explained</h3>
    <p>I used the ratio of those who obtained a bachelors degree or higher and is over the age of 25 compared to the population estimate that is over 25 in the state of Texas. 
        This would show where the most people in the state with college degrees are comparatively to the rest of the state.
    </p>

    <h3>Mode - Equal Count(Quantile)</h3>
    <p>Pros of this allow for distortion to be minimized by increasing the number of classes, so it would potentially look prettier as the colors would slightly get darker and darker. However, a con is that it can be misleading due to features with widely different values potentially in the same class.</p>
