    <h1>Homework 8 - Andrew Spratley</h1>
    <h3>Question: What fraction of hog farms pose a problem to river sources?</h3>

    <h5>Data</h5>
    <p>The data utilized consists of permitted animal facilities gathered from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. This shows all the different permitted facilities and does not limit to just Swine,
        so the data of swine was selected through a attribute filter in QGIS. The overall dataset includes many other potential sources of waste.
