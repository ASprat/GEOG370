    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This map depicts all the power plants in the US that have data of CO2 emissions. The size indicates how much they emit, and one can see the smaller emitters above the large circles if they were to be covered up. 
      I chose this to see where the most impactful polluters are and it was very interesting to see the final distribution of where they all were.</p>
