    <h3>Description of Map</h3>
    <p>
      I am personally a tour guide for Undergraduate Admissions and this is the route we take in order to give prospective students a good feel of Carolina.
      Each of the labels on the stops are what we talk about at each place. The stops are indicated by the yellow dots and the route is indicated by the blue line.
