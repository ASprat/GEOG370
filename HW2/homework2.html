    <h3>Description of Map</h3>
    <p style="width: 1500 px">
      I am personally a tour guide for Undergraduate Admissions and this is the route we take in order to give prospective students a good feel of Carolina.
      Each of the labels on the stops are what we talk about at each place. The stops are indicated by the yellow dots and the route is indicated by the blue line. 
      The internet vector data used was a shapefile from UNC's GIS Service and highlights what is campus property at around 50% opacity.
      I know this may have been more points than intitially requested, but I was having trouble intitially figuring out what I would like to do. So I thought to do this as I work in the office just about everyday.

    <h3>Raster</h3>
    <p>The raster was obtained through an online QGIS plugin that allows one to access the ARCGIS ESRI imagery and put it into QGIS.</p>
    <p>The link used is: <a href = "https://plugins.qgis.org/planet/tag/world%20imagery/">QGIS plugin</a>  </p>

    <h3>Internet Vector</h3>
    <p style="width: 1500 px">Personally, I used the shapefile when creating this document, however, there I realized I could've used the GeoJSON file provided if I had scrolled far enough.</p>
    <p style="width: 1500 px">The internet vector can be found at this link below: <a href="https://gisdata-uncadmin.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1bb4f15c07ee470ab4002a9eb631585a_4/explore?location=35.902984%2C-79.046049%2C14.00">UNC Property Boundary</a></p>

    <h3>GeoJSON Points</h3> 
    <p style="width: 1500 px">The GeoJSON Points can be obtained at the following link from my Github repo:<a href="https://github.com/ASprat/GEOG370/tree/main/HW2/Data">Data Folder</a> </p>
    <p style="width: 1500 px">The JSON points were uploaded in the 4326 format as well as the 3857 format. The 4326 format is indicated by the 4326 in the name. A download of the online vector can also be found here.</p>
